# About

I originally wrote this course in 2018 for Newcastle University's postgraduate
research development programme. The course is aimed at those who already have
*some* experience with LaTeX --- maybe having previously wrote a paper in LaTeX,
or maybe even produced a master's thesis in LaTeX. The idea was to further 
improve on these user's LaTeX skills, iron out any bad habits they'd picked up 
and help them prepare their PhD thesis in LaTeX.
