\begin{frame}{A little about me\ldots}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item I am a 4th year PhD student based in the School of Maths, Stats
      \& Physics
    \item I have $\sim$4 years of \LaTeX{} experience
    \item I also teach the PGRDP course
      \href{https://workshops.ncl.ac.uk/view/book/modal/43153/}%
      {Introduction to git and Github}
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{A little about you\ldots}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item This course is intended for those who already have \emph{some} \LaTeX{} 
      experience
    \item If you want to brush up on the basics then SAgE offer an
      introduction to \LaTeX{} workshop (\emph{not} taught by me)
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{The game plan}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Angela will arrive to check attendance at 1pm
    \item I am more than happy informing Angela of any skivers 
      (\emph{so don't skive})
    \item Exercises are included to break-up the monotony of me talking
  \end{itemize}
